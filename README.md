# STKDec
A pytorch implementation for the paper: Knowledge-enhanced Denoising Diffusion
for Cross-city Battery Swap Demand Prediction.

# Introduction
### Framework of FedDiff

FedDiff is a federated conditional latent diffusion model for cross-city battery swap demand prediction. FedDiff treats each participating battery swapping company as a federated client. Each client independently trains a diffusion model using data from the multiple cities in which it operates, and shares only the model parameters with a central server to update a global model.
Specifically, It involves three stages: (1) local
model training on each client; (2) global model aggregation on the
server; and (3) model convergence and demand prediction.

The local model training on each client consists of two phases: (1) the forward diffusion phase taking the latent representations extracted by the missingness-tolerant masked autoencoder as input; and (2) the reverse denoising phase conditioned on a UKG-based urban environment characterization.
